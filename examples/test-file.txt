This is a test file for Walrus storage integration.

The Walrus protocol provides decentralized storage with:
- Content-addressable storage using blob IDs
- Erasure coding for redundancy
- On-chain coordination via Sui blockchain
- Pay-per-use model with WAL tokens

This file will be uploaded to demonstrate the integration works correctly.
